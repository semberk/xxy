Anisotropic-Gradient-Damage
===========================

Description
===========

Anisotropic-gradient-gamage is an open-source code that provides finite element-based
implementation of anisotropic gradient damage models, that are used for phase-field
simulation of brittle fracture phenomena with weakly and strongly anisotropic surface energy.
It is based on [Fenics-Shells](https://bitbucket.org/unilucompmech/fenics-shells/src/master/) and [FEniCS Project](http://fenicsproject.org).
