Description
===========

Anisotropic-gradient-gamage is an open-source code that provides finite element-based
implementation of anisotropic gradient damage models, that are used for phase-field
simulation of brittle fracture phenomena with weakly and strongly anisotropic surface energy.
It is based on `FEniCS Project <http://fenicsproject.org>`_.
